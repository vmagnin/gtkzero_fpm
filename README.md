# Using gtk-fortran as a fpm dependency

We demonstrate how the Fortran Package Manager [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) can be used to build and run a gtk-fortran program, using gtk-fortran as a fpm dependency. The present `gtkzero_fpm` example is based on the GTK 4 [`gtkzeo_gapp` example](https://github.com/vmagnin/gtk-fortran/blob/gtk4/examples/gtkzero_gapp.f90) and just opens an empty GTK window.

## Requirements

- The GTK 4 development files are supposed to be installed on your system.
- You need fpm,
- and a modern Fortran compiler (>= Fortran 2008).

## The sources

The original `gtkzero_gapp.f90` has been divided in two files `main.f90` and `handlers.f90`. This is the tree of the project, before building:

```bash
├── app
│   └── main.f90
├── build
├── fpm.toml
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── handlers.f90
└── test
    └── check.f90
```

The `fpm.toml` manifest must contain:

```toml
[dependencies]
gtk-fortran = { git = "https://github.com/vmagnin/gtk-fortran.git", branch = "experimental_fpm" }

[build]
link = [
  "gtk-4",
  "pangocairo-1.0",
  "pango-1.0",
  "harfbuzz",
  "gdk_pixbuf-2.0",
  "cairo-gobject",
  "cairo",
  "graphene-1.0",
  "gio-2.0",
  "gobject-2.0",
  "glib-2.0"]
```

## Building and running

The project can be downloaded, built and run very simply:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:vmagnin/gtkzero_fpm.git
$ cd gtkzero_fpm
$ fpm run
```
You should see on screen an empy GTK window with an "hello world" title.

This example is under MIT license. You can therefore use it to begin your own project, and just copy that license above the concerned code sections.
